# PythonTetris
A simple Tetris game created with Python language and PyGame library
The game looks as modern as it was possible for a tetris game, every block that is generated has a random colour, the game acts like every other tetris-inspired game. 
The project was created by me for the purpose of practising pyGame just to understand the basics of this library and this is what I learned from creating this project as well.
Some features that could be added to the game to make it more attractive is the score counter and the message for the user when he loses the game.
